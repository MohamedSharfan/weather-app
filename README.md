# 🌤️ Weather App

Just launched my new mini project — a **Weather App**!

This is a simple, responsive web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** with data fetched from the **OpenWeather API**. You can search any city in the world to get current weather updates along with a 4-day forecast.

## 🔍 Highlights

- ☁️ Real-time weather updates  
- 📅 4-day weather forecast  
- 🔎 Search any city worldwide  
- ⚠️ Error handling for unknown cities or bad input  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) — for real-time and forecast weather data  

## 📚 What I Learned

- Fetching and displaying data from an external API  
- Understanding how APIs work behind the scenes  
- Handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript using `fetch()` and `async/await`  
- Managing UI changes dynamically with JavaScript  
- Building responsive layouts with HTML/CSS  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
